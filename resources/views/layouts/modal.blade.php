                <p class="dark_state">
                  Miko is a self-proclaimed "elite" gamer who is somewhat
                  melodramatic and tends to become emotionally attached to
                  NPCs and inanimate objects. Fans tend to use the term
                  "elite" ironically to highlight Miko's questionable
                  decision-making skills, as well as her tendency to speak
                  garbled nonsense punctuated by the occasional F-bomb.
                  Though Miko specializes in role-playing games, much of the
                  humor on her channel stems from the fact that even while
                  playing graphic and violent games like Grand Theft Auto,
                  she rarely takes her role seriously. Her love for erotic
                  games often finds its way into other games that she plays,
                  especially those featuring freely adjustable camera angles
                  and skirt-wearing female characters. She greets her
                  viewers with "Nyahello".

                <p class="dark_state">
                  Prior to her debut, her appearance is akin to a Shrine
                  Maiden (not traditional-like) with a short pink-hair with
                  an ahoge and a cherry blossom hair ornament in her left as
                  well as pink thigh-highs.
                  <br />
                  In her new outfit, she wears a much more traditional
                  Shrine Maiden outfit along with long detached sleeves, and
                  her stockings are asymmetrical and white instead of pink.
                  The cherry blossom hair ornament is replaced with a bell
                  ribbon, and her hair is longer.
